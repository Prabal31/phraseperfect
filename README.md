## Built With

- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - A JavaScript library for building user interfaces
- [Create React App](https://create-react-app.dev/) - Set up a modern web app by running one command

## Getting Started

To get a local copy up and running, follow these simple steps.

### Prerequisites

- **Node.js** (v14 or higher)
- **npm** (v6 or higher)

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Prabal31/phraseperfect.git
   cd phraseperfect
   ```

2. **Install dependencies:**

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

### Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

#### `npm start`

Runs the app in development mode. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

- The page will reload if you make edits.
- You will also see any lint errors in the console.

#### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in interactive watch mode. See the section about [running tests](https://create-react-app.dev/docs/running-tests) for more information.

#### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.

- It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.
- The build is minified, and the filenames include the hashes.
- Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://create-react-app.dev/docs/deployment) for more information.

#### `npm run eject`

**Note:** This is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

For more information, refer to the [Create React App documentation](https://create-react-app.dev/docs/available-scripts).

### Using `npx`

If you prefer not to install Create React App globally, you can use `npx` to run it without installation:

- To create a new React app (already done for this project):

  ```bash
  npx create-react-app phraseperfect
  ```

- To run the app without installing `react-scripts` globally:

  ```bash
  npx react-scripts start
  ```

## Usage

1. **Start the application:**

   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

2. **Open your browser:**

   Navigate to [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).

3. **Use PhrasePerfect:**

   - Enter the text you want to check or paraphrase.
   - Choose the desired action (Grammar Check or Paraphrase).
   - Review the suggestions and make necessary edits.
